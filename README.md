# Furni – Modern Interior Design Landing Page

A responsive landing page built from a Figma design for a modern interior design studio.  
The layout, colors, and sections closely follow the original Figma concept:  
[`example-1 – Figma`](https://www.figma.com/design/6VelbdlgPa3a7irrMslWk6/example-1?node-id=2-2&t=029VK9M7DpH4Pwbf-4).

- **CSS3** – custom layout, typography, and animations (no frameworks).
- **Responsive design** – desktop‑first with breakpoints for tablets and mobile.

- **Hero section** with call‑to‑action buttons and a hero image.
- **“Crafted With Excellent Material”** product row with cards and hover animations.
- **“Why Choose Us”** section explaining key benefits.
